        "Title": "The Same Celebrities Who Shilled Crypto Are Now Turning Themselves Into Facebook's AI Chatbots",
        "Article Content": "Last month, Meta-formerly-Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg got on stage to unveil a slew of new AI chatbots, many of which are based top-tier celebrities from sports and television.\nThere's a \"wisecracking sports debater\" called Bru, based on NFL legend Tom Brady. There's Tamika, an \"anime-obsessed cosplay expert,\" based on Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka. Calvin \"Snoop Dogg\" Broadus Junior will be your next \"Dungeon Master,\" while Paris Hilton will help you solve whodunnits as \"Amber.\"\nAll told, Meta announced a whopping 28 AIs that you can message on the company's various platforms. Roughly half are based on real-life celebrities, albeit with modified names,¬†some of whom raked in millions for the deals.\nAnd as it turns out, an astonishing number of those celebrities previously cashed in on cryptocurrencies and NFTs ‚Äî or at least they did back before markets bottomed out. Some of them even actively promoted FTX, the collapsed crypto empire whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is on trial this week for defrauding investors of billions of dollars.\nIn other words, the shameful¬†\"crypto to AI pipeline\" is hitting a fever pitch, with stars ditching web3 in favor¬†of the latest cash grab.\nBy our count, three out of the initial 14 celebrities listed in Meta's announcement last month were either directly or indirectly invested in FTX. Two of them, Brady and Osaka, were actually sued over misleading their fans by shilling the exchange.\nIn March 2022, roughly eight months before FTX's collapse, Osaka became an FTX \"global ambassador,\" receiving an equity stake in the company. Brady, also once an FTX ambassador, was featured in TV commercials that promoted the exchange as \"the most trusted\" institution. He was reportedly paid $55 million for roughly 60 hours of work.\nAnd Kendall Jenner's 818 Tequila brand was also embroiled in a $700 million lawsuit involving FTX.\nOutside of FTX, plenty of other celebrities who've signed up for Meta's AI chatbot treatment have also extensively shilled crypto, including Snoop Dogg, who has launched several NFT collections and has been involved in many crypto schemes.\nSimilarly, Hilton is no stranger to the non-fungible tokens, going as far as to show off her own NFT series during an appearance on the \"Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" last year.\nSocial media personalities Jimmy \"MrBeast\" Donaldson, Charli D'Amelio, and Lauren \"LaurDIY\" Riihimaki, who've also agreed to be turned into Meta AIs, have promoted crypto in the past. In a 2021 interview with YouTuber Logan Paul, MrBeast revealed he had invested $1.5 million in Bitcoin. LaurDIY has an entire Instagram account dedicated to \"all things crypto, NFTs, Web3.\"\nIn a sense, at least the stakes aren't as high compared to the still-ongoing FTX debacle. So what if an AI-generated version of your face is being plastered on some lazily put-together social media accounts run by Meta ‚Äî at least you aren't encouraging your fans to buy into some sort of get-rich-quick scheme.\nAt the end of the day, maybe none of this should be surprising. With cryptocurrency and NFT markets in dire straits, these public figures are looking to jump on the next bandwagon. And who could blame them for chasing the paper? Given the astronomical amount of hype surrounding AI these days, there's a lot of cash being thrown around.",

        "Title": "Facebook Is Paying Celebrities Millions to Turn Them Into Chatbots",
        "Article Content": "Facebook's parent company Meta is paying celebrities millions of dollars to let it turn them into silly AI chatbots ‚Äî and to be honest, we're still not entirely sure why.\nAs The Information reports, one unnamed celebrity got as much as $5 million for a mere six hours of work to be turned into one of the AIs.\nLast month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the chatbots, which are based on the personalities of celebrities including Kendall Jenner, Tom Brady, YouTube creator James \"MrBeast\" Donaldson, and TikTok star Charli D'Amelio.\nAs of right now, they're limited to text only, but according to Meta's onstage demo, the company is looking to have these faux celebrities speak with users through video as well.\nBut what does Meta get for its millions of dollars of investments? Besides, who exactly are these chatbots for?\nZuckerberg, for one, is convinced of the tech, telling The Verge last month that there's a \"huge need\" and that \"people want to interact with Kylie,\" referring to the \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star, adding that \"it'll be fun for consumers.\" (While Kylie Jenner isn't currently on Meta's list of celebrity chatbots, her sister Kendall Jenner is.)\nWhether there's any truth to Zuckerberg's sentiment remains to be seen. And given the reactions so far, which have been mixed to say the least, the feature could turn out to be nothing more than a short-lived and ill-advised attempt to cash in on the current hype around AI.\nFor one, the marketing has been nothing less than confusing. Instead of explicitly selling these AI personalities by using their real names, Meta has given each chatbot an altered moniker, perhaps in an attempt to preempt any potential defamation lawsuits. Jenner's chatbot is called \"Billie,\" for instance, while Brady's assistant is called \"Bru.\"\nBillie even got her own Instagram account, introducing herself in a perplexing video¬†that may or may not have been the product of a generative AI itself.\n\"Chatting with me is like having an older sister you can talk to, but who can‚Äôt steal your clothes,\" the bot wrote in the video's caption.\nThe eerie clip clearly didn't hit the mark, with confused commenters calling it \"so creepy\" and \"honestly scary.\"\n\"Is this legal?\" one Instagram user wrote. \"Did Kendall consent to this?\"\nThen there's the question of having famous people give up their likeness to train an AI at all. As Jezebel points out, the Screen Actor's Guild, which is currently on strike, has warned of studios trying to scan background performers to avoid paying them more than \"one day's pay.\"\nThe union has demanded protections from developers exploiting actors by creating AI-generated works or reproducing their voices and likenesses without their explicit consent or remuneration.\nAs of right now, Meta's celebrity AIs are still in a limited beta, and considering the sheer amount of mayhem AI chatbots have caused over the past year or so, the company will likely tread very carefully, especially considering these celebrities' reputations are at stake.\nIn other words, it's presumably only a matter of time until users find ways to exploit these chatbots and skirt around Meta's guardrails.¬†When they do, what will their celebrity sources think?\nAbove all, it's a perplexing attempt to shoehorn AI tech into Meta's existing products. Chances are celebs like Brady are simply looking to cash in, not unlike when he took $55 million¬†to endorse¬†the since-collapsed crypto exchange FTX.\nIn short, there's clearly some quick money to be made. But whether that'll remain the case remains to be seen, especially considering the fate of FTX and other NFT ventures that were heavily endorsed by celebrities before the market fell apart.",

        "Title": "Elon Musk Is in Big Trouble Over the Israel-Palestine Violence",
        "Article Content": "As the Israel-Palestine crisis unfolds, a massive barrage of disinformation has hit X-formerly-Twitter ‚Äî and regulators are watching in horror.\nManipulated and fake images are widely circulating on the platform, a dire situation compounded by X owner Elon Musk's gutting of the company's workforce, including its content moderation team, following his chaotic takeover last year.\nIn an \"urgent letter\" addressed to X owner Elon Musk, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, accused the platform of enabling the dissemination of \"illegal content and disinformation in the EU\" and ordered Musk to file a response \"within the next 24 hours,\" ensuring \"that your systems are effective, and report on the crisis measures taken.\"\nBreton also wrote that the \"violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform,\" after Musk made \"changes in public interest policies\" was leaving \"many European users uncertain.\"\nAt 24 hours since Breton shared his letter, Musk has yet to show any indication of interest in making changes to X's policies.\nIt didn't take long for the outspoken billionaire to respond to Breton's request, albeit without actually addressing the issue.\n\"Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports,\" Musk wrote in a confounding tweet. \"Please list the violations you allude to on ùïè, so that that the public can see them.\"\nBreton didn't take kindly to the suggestion, telling Musk that it's \"up to you to demonstrate that you walk the talk.\"\nBy all indications, Musk has yet to officially write a response or make X's content policies sufficiently clear beyond telling Breton that \"we take our actions in the open.\"\nMusk's telltale gut reaction of doubling down on his laissez-faire vision is telling, especially he's been actively contributing to the issue himself. In a since-deleted tweet, Musk recommended that users follow two accounts that have historically spread dangerous lies and made antisemitic comments, as The Washington Post reports.\nIt's still unclear if the European Commission will end up taking action or imposing \"penalties\" due to non-compliance, as Breton's letter warns.\nThe EU's recently enacted Digital Services Act requires any platforms with more than 45 million monthly active users to scan for illegal content and take it down as well. Companies can get fined up to six percent of their global turnover if they don't comply with the new rules.\nThat kind of penalty could turn out to be a major hit for a platform that is already in deep financial turmoil.\nIn short, the Israel-Palestine conflict could be seen as the first major international crisis to stress test Musk's social media platform ‚Äî and given his apparent disinterest in tackling disinformation, he appears to be failing miserably.",

        "Title": "Twitter CEO Says That Due to Reasons, She Has to Cancel Appearance Defending Elon Musk‚Äôs Deranged Behavior",
        "Article Content": "Looks like X-formerly-Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino's speaking tour is on pause for the foreseeable future.\nYaccarino announced that she has bowed out of her scheduled appearance at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference, slated to kick off next week.\nAccording to X, she's busy.\n\"With the global crisis unfolding, Linda and her team must remain fully focused on X platform safety,\" reads X's official statement shared by WSJ tech columnist Joanna Stern, likely referring to the situation in Israel and Gaza.\nBut considering Yaccarino's disastrous appearance at a conference last month and X owner Elon Musk's continuing promotion of notorious, misinformation-peddling accounts on the platform, there's clearly a lot more behind her decision.\nLate last month, Yaccarino sat down with CNBC's Julia Boorstin at Code, The Verge's annual tech and business conference. The bizarre interview was nothing short of a trainwreck. Among other odd claims and confrontational behavior, as recapped by The Verge, Yaccarino made sweeping statements about X's user figures without actually providing any hard numbers to back them up.\nShe also said Boorstin was \"not nice\" in response to an arguably fair question concerning Yaccarino's reputation as \"CEO in name only,\" and downplayed online threats directed at¬†Yoel Roth, Twitter's former head of trust and safety who was forced to leave his home after being accused of pedophilia by Musk.\nOn that note, throughout the conversation, Yaccarino oscillated between defending and clumsily attempting to side-step questions regarding the behavior of the platform's mercurial owner, who ‚Äî despite having passed on the CEO role to the #girlboss in question ‚Äî continues to announce surprise site changes and product rollouts in X posts and threatening to sue nonprofits like the Anti-Defamation League for calling attention to antisemitism on the platform.\nTo be clear, focusing on the violent crisis in Israel and Gaza would be a worthy way for Yaccarino to spend her time, considering that X has been flooded with disinformation pertaining to the bloody conflict and, as the result of Musk's mass workforce cullings, seemingly no longer has the trust and safety staff required to manage content related to these kinds of global events.\nIt also doesn't help that in a now-deleted post on the platform, Musk, told users over the weekend that two notorious accounts that promote lies and unverifiable news are a good way to follow \"the war in real-time,\" per The Washington Post.\nSo, yeah, Yaccarino has a lot on her hands. Still, it's hard to believe that her decision to cancel her Tech Live appearance has nothing¬†to do with her most recent onstage performance.\nAt the same time, when it comes to having to stand up for Musk's actions and confront his questionable behavior, we wouldn't want to publicly answer any questions, either.",
